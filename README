== What's this? ==

Simple command line PostgreSQL Monitor to display
the status of SR/HS PostgreSQL nodes. To gain more in-detail
description of this tool, simply call

   $ perldoc pg_standby_status

== Prerequisites ==

pg_standby_status.pl requires a Perl environment and a working
DBI-Installation. Since it monitors PostgreSQL servers directly
by querying all nodes, it requires the DBD:Pg drivers to be installed.
It also requires the Perl Curses modules to be installed.

== Usage ==

From any terminal, simply type 

   $ pg_standby_status MASTER_DSN [ STANDBY_DSN1, ... ]

where MASTER_DSN is the DBI connection string to the master, and
STANDBY_DSNn the DBI connection string to any slave, e.g.

   $ pg_standby_status "host=master dbname=mydb" "host=slave dbname=mydb"
